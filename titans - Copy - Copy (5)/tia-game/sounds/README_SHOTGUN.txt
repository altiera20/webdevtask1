SHOTGUN SOUND FOR TITAN ELIMINATION

To complete the titan elimination feature with the shotgun sound effect:

1. Add a file named "shotgun.mp3" to this directory
2. You can find free shotgun sound effects on websites like:
   - Freesound.org
   - Pixabay.com/sound-effects/
   - Mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/

The game is already configured to use this sound when a titan is eliminated.
